Provided are the countries with the highest revenue, number of countries, number of sales, and revenue per customer. Things to note
* All in western europe
* United Kingdom dominates: % of overall customers, % of revenue, % of sales.
* Revenue per customer (how much a customer every year) introduces some outliers.

* Country-level data (literacy rates, access to electricity, GDP per capita) aggregated to the sales data.
* Ran a regression tree and revealed that there are three segments of countries
* High revenue countries had much higher revenue, larger markets, revenue per customer, customers, and sales. 
  * However, not associated with higher GDP. High revenue market had lower GDP than medium revenue market.
  * Low revenue includes some developing countries.
